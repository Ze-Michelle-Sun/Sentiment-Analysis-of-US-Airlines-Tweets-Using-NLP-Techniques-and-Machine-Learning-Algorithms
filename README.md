# Sentiment-Analysis-of-US-Airlines-Tweets-Using-NLP-Techniques-and-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
## Introduction
Sentiment analysis is one of the important fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP) which involves analyzing and understanding the sentiment of any piece of text. With the advent of various social media platforms, companies focus on them for customer feedback and communication to understand their customers' sentiments toward their products and services. 
## Problem Statement
Awareness of customer opinion, emotions, and attitudes toward a particular brand or product can be gained through sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis was performed on tweets related to US airlines in the year 2015 for this project, using various machine learning techniques such as SVM, boosting, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, CNN, and more. The objective is to address the following research questions:

-	What is the relationship between airline sentiments and airlines?

-	What is the reason for the negativity mentioned in the dataset?

-	What is the relation of time with sentiments?

-	Which model is best for sentiment analysis when using machine learning?

## Methodology
- In this project, we focused on analyzing the sentiment of tweets related to US airlines in the year 2015 using various machine learning techniques like SVM, boosting, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, etc. The dataset we had consisted of customer tweets, and we tried to address research questions related to airline sentiments and airlines, reasons for negativity, the relationship between time and sentiments, and identifying the best model for sentiment analysis using ensemble learning. 

- Explored various Text-Representations techniques in NLP like one-hot encoding, bag-of-words, TF-IDF and Word2Vec.

## Conclusion
- In conclusion, performed a sentimental analysis of tweets about US airlines using various NLP techniques such as one-hot encoding, bag-of-words, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec. Explored the dataset through graphs and analyzed the sentiments of tweets. Then compared the performance of different algorithms such as XGB Classifier, SVM, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and CNN in predicting the sentiment of tweets. 

- Findings showed that SVM performed the best with an accuracy score of 91.30%, followed by boosting with an accuracy score of 85.38%. 

- Also identified limitations such as bias in the dataset and the need for more diverse data for better generalization. Recommendations include addressing the limitations and exploring more advanced NLP techniques for better sentiment analysis.

- Overall, this project demonstrates the usefulness of NLP techniques in analyzing public sentiment toward different industries and organizations.
